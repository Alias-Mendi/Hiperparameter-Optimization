Hi this is my first project in Github. 

In this project we are going to search alternatives to the famous grd search. We will use optimization problem to search the best hiperparameters to tune the XGB Regressor.

The Algorithms used are:
    -> GA (Genetic Algorithm)
    -> PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization )
    -> NSGAII for muultivariable optimization


Please make sure yo install 'requirements.txt'. *To quick install -> pip install -r requirements.txt*

Python version = 3.12.5

The dataset is California Housing Dataset from Scikit Learn library, yo can download it from Kaggle in *https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices*

I hope you find it interesting :)
