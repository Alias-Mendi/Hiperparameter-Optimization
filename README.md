Welcome to my first GitHub project!

Project Goal:

In this project, we're exploring alternatives to traditional grid search for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning. We'll focus on the XGBoost Regressor and use optimization algorithms to find the best hyperparameter combinations.

Algorithms:

GA (Genetic Algorithm)
PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization)
NSGA-II (for multi-objective optimization)
Prerequisites:

Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can quickly do this by running:

Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usa el código con precaución.

Important Notes:

Python Version: This project uses Python 3.12.5.
Dataset: We'll be working with the California Housing dataset. You can download it from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices   
I hope you enjoy this project and find it informative! Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.
